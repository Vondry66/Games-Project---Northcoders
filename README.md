Hello and Welcome to my humble Project.

To run this project locally, please do the following :

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development.
Into each, add PGDATABASE=nc_games, and PGDATABASE=nc_games_test with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).

Please double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
